# AlleleProfileR

Gene editing strategies, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9), are revolutionizing biochemistry. Potent, yet flexible, bioinformatics technologies are required to aid in the profiling of the generated transgenic cell lines, plants or animals. Here, we present AlleleProfileR, a novel analysis tool, written in a combination of R and C++, with the ability to batch process the sequence analysis of large and complex experiments, including base editing and large deletions created by using two guides.
